### 1 - Goal

The game should consist in a multiplayer mode. the different player controls a city in ancient Greece. Each city is linked to a Divinity and has two main ressources :
##
* Corn
* Gold
##
Moreover, each city has units that will be used for attack and defense.

Each Divinity needs its followers to make offerings, which can contains either **gold**, **corn**, or both.
Please your God, and it will act kindly towards your city.
Every once in a while a special event called **Benediction** might happen. This will give you bonuses to ressources.
On the other hand, your god might treat you with contempt, and a **Retribution** will happen, which will most likely scar your city.

If you fail to please your god, it will wrath the earth.
