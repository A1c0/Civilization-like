### 1 - Goal ###

The game should consist in a solo mode. the player controls a city in ancient Greece. Each city is linked to a Divinity and has three main ressources :
##
* Corn
* Gold
* Soldiers
##

Each Divinity needs its followers to make offerings, which can contains either **gold**, **corn**, or both.
Please your God, and it will act kindly towards your city.
Every once in a while a special event called **Benediction** might happen. This will give you bonuses to ressources.
On the other hand, your god might treat you with contempt, and a **Retribution** will happen, which will most likely scar your city.

If you fail to please your god, it will wrath the earth.
